# NMAP-Scanning-Project2

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Nmap (Network Mapper) for network reconnaissance, host discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration. The goal is to showcase practical knowledge of network scanning, security analysis, and documentation of results.
By simulating a penetration tester’s approach, this project highlights how Nmap can be used responsibly to understand a network’s surface and identify potential security exposures.

**Objectives**

* To understand how Nmap performs host discovery and port scanning.
* To practice different Nmap scanning techniques (ping scan, TCP scan, service/version detection).
* To document scan results in a structured and professional format.
* To build a simple, reproducible GitHub project showcasing applied cybersecurity skills.

Nmap Commands
```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.100
```
